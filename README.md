# crowd-counting
main code is in crowd.py
you need to download the dataset ShanghaiTech which i have used to train the model.
It almost take 5 hours to train the model and you may run out of memory so better to use any cloud complier.
To reduce the time I have used the pickle and saved the weights of the model in order to reduce the time from 5 hours to 1 minute.
